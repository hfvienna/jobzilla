About Ought
Ought is a product-driven machine learning lab building Elicit, an AI research assistant. Elicit uses
language models to automate and support research processes like literature and evidence review. Elicit
applies frontier technology to serious use cases, enabling our research team to understand in great
detail where language models fail and how to mitigate such failures.

About the role
As a product manager at Ought, your mission is to build products applying state-of-the-art AI
technologies towards helping the world reason. You’ll have access to new language models and tools
before the rest of the world does. You’ll be instrumental in ensuring that these technologies are
understood well and deployed carefully. 
You’ll step into a strong foundation. As of January 2023, Elicit has around 170,000 total users. 70,000
are active each month and 7,000 use it more than once a week. It is growing over 50% each month,
entirely by word of mouth; you can see our users' feedback on our Twitter page. We’ve launched a
feature almost every week since launch. You can see the most recent launches here. We already have a
team of experts in design, front-end, full-stack engineering, and machine learning. We have a rapidly
growing and super engaged user base eager to spend hours sharing feedback on prototypes and
showing us their current workﬂows. Elicit is one of the most advanced applications of language models
right now.
But we want to take it to the next level. We dream of helping signiﬁcantly more people with signiﬁcantly
more types of thinking. That’s where you come in. Take the foundations we’ve established and build
something with an even bigger impact. 
There is no other role like this. You’ll work in a space where every day brings leaps forward in the
technological capabilities of the models. You’ll design entirely new, language-model-ﬁrst paradigms.
You’ll prioritize true, lasting impact and not short-term proﬁts.
