# Jobzilla

Jobzilla stomps onto the job search scene, ferociously sniffing out opportunities like a wild beast on the hunt, aggressively tracking down opportunities and crushing its competition with its monstrous AI might.

Jobzilla is a revolutionary AI-powered job hunting tool designed to automate and simplify the job search process in the modern era.

## Features
1. Automated Job Search: Jobzilla utilizes a robust AI to search and scrape job opportunities across the internet, effectively automating the job search process.
2. Personalized Job Ranking: Our app grades job offers based on user-specific preferences, providing a tailored ranking of job opportunities. Users can customize their search criteria, including job location, work hours, industry, and company size.
3. Auto Job Application: If a job offer meets a certain user-defined threshold, Jobzilla applies on their behalf using the user's resume. This eliminates the need for manual job applications.

## Why Jobzilla?
Jobzilla sets itself apart by personalizing the job hunt experience while increasing efficiency and reducing stress. By automating the job search and application process, Jobzilla transforms the traditional, manual job hunting to a tailored, streamlined experience.

If you copy and paste the tree into an environment that uses a monospace font (like most code editors or terminals), the vertical lines (│) align correctly. If you're seeing misalignment this is due to GitHub's markdown renderer.

## Next.js






This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
